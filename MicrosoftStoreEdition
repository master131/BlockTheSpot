BlockTheSpot by master131 on Microsoft Store Edition? YES!
I found this way alone. By 7evenlxrd ;)

Requiments: 
1. netutils.dll (this is BlockTheSpot)
2. You need Ubuntu (installed on disk or live cd/usb doesn't matters).
Steps:
1. Run Ubuntu
2. Run File Explorer (in ubuntu), click on Other Locations then click on your disk with Windows 10.
3. Go to where is a BlockTheSpot (netutils.dll) and copy this
4. Go to Program Files, double click WindowsApps.
5. Find a Spotify folder (SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_ and something)
6. Go to Properties, Permissons and give all permissions (create and delete files)
7. Paste BlockTheSpot (netutils.dll) to Spotify folder.
8. Restart to Windows 10.

Enjoy ;)
